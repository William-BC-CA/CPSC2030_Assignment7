# Notes
- for printing result, use the one from sample-output, replace with $_POST(date), loop through checkboxes with for each, etc.
- the_validation_message doesn't require check! Just print the errors!
- you don't need to use count, set a flag in validate!
- remember, the animals thing, you need to use foreach!
