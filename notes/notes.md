# Notes
- [x] for printing result, use the one from sample-output, replace with $_POST(date), loop through checkboxes with for each, etc.
- [ ] the_validation_message doesn't require check! Just print the errors!
- [ ] you don't need to use count, set a flag in validate!
- [ ] remember, the animals thing, you need to use foreach!
- [ ] watch overview hints video!
- [x] check isset for email and date!
- [x] for each inside for post type value!
- [x] if statement to check if the type is email
- [x] break it down, make sure that preg_match has two parameters.
